# 🧠 Feature Selection and Classification for Banking Dataset

This project aims to analyze a dataset by applying multiple **feature selection techniques** and comparing their performance in predicting customer subscription behavior. The system includes both **a Python backend** and an interactive **Streamlit application** for easy data analysis and visualization.

##  Project Features

 Supports any CSV dataset upload  
 Choose the target (label) column from the data  
 Automatically encodes categorical features  
 Compares multiple feature selection algorithms:
- **SelectKBest**
- **PCA (Principal Component Analysis)**
- **Genetic Algorithm Feature Selection (GA)**

 Shows best-selected features  
 Saves results in `results.joblib`  
 Built-in classifier: Logistic Regression  
 Faster GA evaluation by sampling only first 300 rows  
 Automatically limits GA-selected features to max **50**
